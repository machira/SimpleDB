This is a very simple database built on top of the JSON file format. This is mostly done as a learning tool for the primitives that make up modern database technology. The roadmap looks something like:

- [x] Simple Querying; create, query, update, delete.
- [ ] Something
- [ ] Something
- [ ] Something else
- [ ] Indexed Querying as an optimization of the above.

   
   I do this mostly to understand the internals for myself, and perhaps to share it with others. If you want to contribute to or have feedback on this effort, reach out!
